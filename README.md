darwin-score
============

A method to evaluate text representing a natural history bio-collection object. Scores calculated in this process can help provide a rough evaluation of the quality of the text whether it be generated by human transcription or OCR. Initially, this will focus on labels and annotations applied to herbarium collections. This process will check the text for valid English words as well as taxonomic names, collector names, annotator names, location names, common abbreviations and other expected words and values. The text is given a score based on the number and closeness of the matches found.
