# TODO

- Allow command line parameters for input, output, etc.
- Fix various character encoding issues
- Error checking
- Lots of little fixes to make it cleaner
- Add tools for expanding and augmenting dictionaries
- Add weighted score for patterns (which should account for the fact that pattern matches aren't robust and may have false positives)
- Use select pattern files from https://github.com/jbest/regex-repo as input
- What else? Let me know.
